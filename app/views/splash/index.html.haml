We  owe  it  to  ourselves  to  give  that  innate  intelligence  a  chance  to  express  itself  fully;  reducing  pressure  on  the  nervous  systems  gives  us  the  best  opportunity  to  heal  ourselves.

        %h2 Rowe chiropractic is a specialist in locating and correcting subluxation - rewiring communication so that the brain can talk to the body again.

        %p The lives we live create an impression on our nervous system and on our posture. When our minds and bodies feel stress, it imprints on our skeleton system as subluxation, or an interruption in the nervous system. We employ different modalities to repair our bodies, but if the brain is not talking to the body, the body can’t be healthy. As much as we learn about and hope to maintain our health through stress management, diet, and exercise. the most important - one small misalignment - can create subluxations that turn the volume of our brain/body communication down.
